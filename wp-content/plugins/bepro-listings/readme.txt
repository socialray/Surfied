[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfASHxSNIHY /]

Bepro Listings allows you to create posts with a combination of additional information like, costs, contact, or geography. Widgets and shortcodes then help you to search and view this information via various formats including google maps. Consider using these building blocks for your next listing site. 

= Popular Uses =

This plugin is best utilized by those looking to implement listing type features into their own custom design. Setup categories and control various aspects including, number of images, default search distance, and page details. With the new buddypress option, you can allow your members to control their own submissions (add/edit/delete). Look at some of the ways people are using the plugin:

* Store Finder - List your stores including, location and contact details 
* Directory - Employee, Business, Classifieds, Job Search, Fleet Tracking, Job Board, or any other type of listings site
* Products & Services - List them yourself or allow your members to list products and/or services
* Informational - Tourism, points of interest, and other details best shown via map
* User Contributions - Using the submission form shortcode, let users contribute blog posts for you to review and publish
