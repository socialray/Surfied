Allows to decide buddypress website admins where their users should land after log in.

== Description ==
This plugin gives an option to buddypress based website owners to decide that where their users should be redirected after the login. Currently users can be redirected to 3 different locations after login.
1. Personal Profile / Personal Activity Page
2. Site wide Activity
3. Friends' Activity
4. Same page before log in

By default, this plugin will redirect the users to their friends' activity page after login.

== Installation ==
1. Upload `bp-login-redirect` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== FAQ ==
1. I don't want to show my homepage to logged in users.
Ans. In that case, you should use BP Profile as Homepage, which is designed for pure social networking websites.

2. This plugin is not working.
Ans: Make sure you hae not installed any other plugin which is performing redirection at the time of log in.
